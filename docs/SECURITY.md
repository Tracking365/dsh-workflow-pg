# Security boundary

## Deployment status

This release is for trusted, local fixtures and control-plane evaluation only. Native DSH
execution is disabled. It must not be enabled for untrusted repositories or real business
work by renaming a live adapter to `fixture`.

An independent Git copy is workflow isolation, NOT OS isolation. Process groups are
best-effort cancellation, NOT a sandbox: a hostile process can escape its group, access
host files, use the network, or forge TAP output. Path/snapshot checks are post-hoc guards
and have filesystem race limits. Therefore real code execution deliberately fails closed.

## Implemented controls

Task inputs cannot set host policy, arbitrary commands, output paths, approval or readiness.
Repository/profile references resolve through trusted host policy. Task create pins a
committed baseline; dirty source files are not copied, reset or stashed. Test/allowed-path
hashes and verification/review evidence bind to the candidate snapshot. A model never
writes the SQLite store through an exposed tool. Store events and state changes commit
in one transaction; database files use 0600. Persistent leases have no automatic TTL
reclaim. A failed stop proof retains the lease and yields `interrupted`, not `cancelled`.

Shell interpolation is not used. Child processes get an environment allowlist, not model
keys or NODE_OPTIONS. Output and model context are bounded. The HTTP reviewer has no tools,
uses explicit HTTPS configuration and a separate credential callback, rejects redirects,
checks response shape/model identity, and rejects known credential patterns in context.
Regex redaction is best-effort, not a complete secret detector. Do not pass real secrets.

`git()` disables hooks for generated fixture repositories; it is not a production Git
adapter and does not implement organization signing/hooks policies. No host commit/push/
merge/deployment feature is exposed. Patches remain local and fixture evidence stays labeled.

`accept()` is a trusted in-process API, not a model tool. Its actor string is NOT an
authentication mechanism. Only trusted host code may invoke it; authenticated approval
capabilities, binding to operator identity and expiration remain unimplemented.

## Explicit gaps / do not relax these to make tests pass

* No Codex native sandbox adapter, network egress enforcement, credential broker or readonly
  tool-using reviewer; live runs remain blocked.
* No automatic crash recovery or PID/lease reclamation. `resume` raises
  `RECOVERY_REQUIRES_OPERATOR`; do not delete a lease while an old writer may still exist.
* No multi-user authorization boundary for shared DSH sessions. Use a private local profile.
* Reproduction uses a frozen, trusted Node TAP test plan. A general-purpose expected failure
  signature and newly proposed regression overlay are not implemented. A failed assertion
  alone is not sufficient for arbitrary business bugs outside this fixture.
* A host `confirmFinding` callback is the trusted evidence seam. The supplied tests use an
  explicit stub; independent production evidence adjudication remains to be built.
* Review context currently includes task, patch and test evidence, not a complete bounded
  project-context retriever. Large repositories are rejected, not silently truncated.
* Process termination is tested on Linux only. Windows/macOS live behavior is unverified.

Shutdown aborts and awaits owned cooperative work. A non-cooperative adapter can still hang;
production needs an independently killable sandbox. Persistent artifacts are never deleted
as a side effect of plugin disposal. Reinstall/uninstall is not rollback.
